It is a Twitter interview question someone shared on the Web.  When I saw it I deciced to try it for fun.  

The problem is that: given the height of a series of walls, calculate the volume of the puddles formed during heavy rain. For example, the walls with heights [6,2,15] will collect 7 units of rain water.

The implementation in C is the "single-pass" solution, shared by some other guys.  It is drmatically simple and more elegant than the other fours.  If one can work out the "single-pass" solution under an interview setting, he/she is trule awsome.
